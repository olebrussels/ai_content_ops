##### what makes your website unique? 
What idea or product do you ‘sell’ ?

We encourage our readers to stay curious, explore and build capacity to move from SAAS to custom apps. Empower smes with learning and becoming a bit more tech savy and proficient each day. one step at a time. 

We are software agnostic. We dont sell a specific brand or platform. We encourage our clients to actually code more and develop their tools inhouse. it's a journey towards more freedom. 

The agency believes in promoting a healthier interdependence with tech tools, freeing up time for SMEs through process automation, and liberating time through AI for SMEs.

And why should people buy this from you? I have done a personal journey towards coding and self hosting. 

#### Tone of voice
how do we feel about our message? 
because we are passionate about what we do , we want our tone to sound enthusiastic about what we are doing. 

because we are big kids we are playful. we want to break the stablished patterns and look at things with new eyes. we are irreverent. 

this is a one man company. the owner is a trained lawyer and appreciates precise wording and formality.  we want to say words with precission. always focusing on less words but ensuring that value is delivered in every sentence and paragraph. 

we accept jokes but we can live without them.
