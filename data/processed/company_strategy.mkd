## Vision

Our agency envisions a future where tech tools hold significant weight in company decisions surrounding transformation. Our agency envisions a future where tech tools are regarded not merely as operational facilities but as allies in driving a company’s and world transformation. __We are committed to helping organizations recognize and nurture this alliance__ to accelerate their evolution towards a more conscious relationship with people and planet.

Our aspiration is to __shift the balance of power within the tech landscape__, moving away from the illusion of unlimited growth, towards a decentralized, sovereign feminist model based on principles of care and respect for the humans and the planet underlying our technology.

The agency places a strong focus on data literacy, computer literacy, technical culture, 
culture of care and reparation, adaptive learning, open source and sovereign digital infrastructure.



### Our why?  

We believe in driving healthier relationships between SME workers and their tech tools. Our concern is not just the tools themselves, but how they shape practices. We are committed to aiding businesses in liberating time through process automation and AI, allowing for better human connections and reducing the burnout caused by systems designed for endless engagement. Our objective is to infuse organizations with a mindset that inspires curiosity, exploration, comprehension and the courage to repair – to interrogate not only how our tools work, but how they affect the world around us.


### Our juste cause 

Our cause is centered around educating SMEs about the __intimate connection between tech tools and their social/environmental impact__. We aim to guide businesses in a co-evolution with technology, fostering an environment of critique and understanding of the power dynamics behind these tools. As such, we ensure their tech "stack" transforms in unison with organizational changes, shaping meaningful connections and responsible practices.
