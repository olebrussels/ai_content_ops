# Audio File Journey Summary 📁→🎙️

## What Happens Before AssemblyAI Transcription:

### 1. **Phone Recording & Upload**
- You record audio on your phone
- Rename file with `blog_` prefix (e.g., `blog_meeting_notes.wav`)
- keep them on my phone for batch processing.
- Batch Upload via Nextcloud app on phone

### 2. **Nextcloud Sync Process**
```
Phone → Nextcloud Server → Local Nextcloud Client
```
- File appears in `/home/manuel/accion_new/Talk/`
- **First**: Nextcloud creates temp file `.blog_meeting_notes.wav.~abc123`
- **Then**: Nextcloud renames/moves temp file to final `blog_meeting_notes.wav`

### 3. **File Monitor Detection**
```
start the watchdog . go to .venv with source .venv/bin/activate
python file_monitor.py



👀 Watchdog monitors /home/manuel/accion_new/Talk/
🔍 Detects CREATED event → Ignores (temp file)
🔍 Detects MOVED event → Triggers! (final file)
Deletes the file in /home/manuel/accion_new/Talk/. 
```

### 4. **Pre-Processing Steps**
```
📁 Original: /home/manuel/accion_new/Talk/blog_meeting_notes.wav
📋 Copy to: /Documents/tech/ai_content_ops/data/temp/blog_meeting_notes.wav
🎯 Ready for AssemblyAI transcription in test_langgraph.ipynb pipeline
